\chapter{Experimental Setup}\label{experimental_setup}
	\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}
		In order to improve on previous works (cite Leonie, section \ref{related_work}), we require that our method fulfills following criteria:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{R1: Minimal distance to water surface}: This requirement defined our experimental setup. As shown in figures \ref{fig:aquarium_setup} and \ref{fig:aelotron_setup}, lighting bubbles from below gives more freedom for the camera to be closer to the water surface. This is more apparent when the camera faces the surface with a certain angle. 
		\item \textbf{R2: Consistent image results}: Bubbles can look very different under different lighting conditions. For instance, bubbles might appear as dark disks or bright rings (chapter \ref{related_work}) depending how they are lit. We therefore require that the angle between camera and light source is always constant. This requirement guarantees a consistent pattern for bubbles across different water tanks.
		\item \textbf{R3: Images must contain all possibly retrievable information}. From our simulation (figure \ref{subfig:bubble_simulation}) we know that bubbles are characterized by two peaks. Both of these – especially the upper, dimmer one – are required to be visible. This requires the camera to have a high signal-to-noise ratio and/or the light source to be very bright. 
	\end{itemize}	
		
	\section{Aquarium Setup}
	%TODO 2 more columns for different setups

			\label{fig:aquarium_setup}
		\end{figure}			
		
		The goal of this setup is to capture bubble images that can be used to prototype our algorithm, so we built the experiment in a transparent $1m \times 1m \times 1m$ water tank as shown in figure \ref{fig:aquarium_setup} where we could change most of the parameters such as lighting angle, camera and bubble concentration independently from each other. Measurement results are discussed in next chapter and image analysis is discussed in chapter \ref{the_algorithm}.
		
		In order to satisfy requirements in section \ref{requirements}, we opted for the following parameters (also summarized in table \ref{tab:aquarium_param})
		
		\begin{itemize}
		%TODO convert list to text. 
		\item \textbf{Camera} We chose the Basler A1920 mainly because of its high signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore fulfilling requirement R3 given enough light. Its main drawback is its relatively low frame rate at the highest possible resolution, which makes bubble tracking more difficult, which in turn makes radius calibration more difficult (see section \ref{calibration_setup}. Compared to an available high-speed camera with comparable maximum resolution, (PCO Dimax, 1,2kHz at $2000 \times 2000$ resolution) our chosen camera also has a smaller sensor. This means that the magnification factor is higher and therefore smaller bubbles can be better detected.
		
		\item \textbf{Lens} A 100 mm macro lens was used in this setup. The large focal length yields a large magnification, which is desired.
		\item \textbf{Exposure time} This value depends on the maximum speed of bubbles. In this setup, no waves are present, so a bubble's speed is proportional to its radius. 
		\item \textbf{Gamma value}
		\item \textbf{F-number} This value has been chosen such that the depth of field is a few centimeters large (see also section \ref{calibration_setup})		
		\item \textbf{Air flow} Bubbles were produced by an bubble generator. Bubble radii therefore depend on the amount of air flowing through the bubble generator (measured in liter per minute or LPM).

	\section{Aeolotron Setup}
		%TODO Table as 4.1
		The Aeolotron is an experimental annular wind-wave facility with a diameter of about 10m and a width of about 60cm. Typical water height is 1m. Four wind engines generate reference wind speeds of up to 14m/s, enough to generate breaking waves that in turn produce air bubbles. Figure \ref{fig:aeolotron_setup} shows a schematic view of the wind facility as well as the experimental setup.
		
		The goal of this setup is to apply the knowledge gained from the previous setup on bubble measurements emerging from breaking waves, so we reproduced the setup from the aquarium at the Aeolotron, while keeping as many unchanged parameters as possible (e.g. same camera, same light source same lens etc...). 
		
	We also used a bubble generator first, to verify that the algorithm developed for the previous setup still works with measurements from the Aeolotron setup. Some parameters such as focus distance and angle between the light source and bubbles were inevitably changed, which means we needed to calibrate the depth of field again.

			Figures \ref{fig:aqauarium_result}, \ref{fig:aquarium_result_high_conc} and \ref{fig:aeolotron_result} show different images captured using a bubble generator in two different water tanks. For low bubble concentrations, images look very similar across the two different setups. However, when the concentration is very high (figure \ref{fig:aquarium_result_high_conc}) bubbles change dramatically. The curvature can be easily distinguished and scattered light from other bubbles gives bubbles a more circular shape. Also, the background is much brighter for a high bubble concentration. The exact bubble shape will be discussed further in chapter \ref{the_algorithm}.	
	
	
	\section{Calibration}\label{calibration_setup}
		\subsection{Depth of Field}\label{sub:depth_of_field_setup}
			Since we want to determine the measurement volume, we need to not only detect bubbles in an image, but also determine their depth, i.e. distance to the focal plane. With the experimental setup shown in figure \ref{fig:depth_of_field_setup}, we can capture bubbles and move them along the depth axis. 
			
			Figure \ref{fig:depth_of_field_setup_result} shows images captured with this setup. Note how blurriness varies among images depending on the distance to focal point. In section \ref{calibration_algorithm} we discuss how to extract depth form these images. The setup is not perfectly stable, so images not perfectly aligned. As a workaround, we took additional images with a different light source at each position to make other objects visible, e.g. armature of calibration device that can later on be used for tracking and stabilization. 
			
			This calibration is practical, because we do not need to determine the absolute distance to the camera. So only relative distances to focal plane are needed for a depth calibration.

		\subsection{Radius}\label{sub:radius_setup}
			Although simulation shows that the distance between the two dominant peaks in a bubble is proportional to the bubble radius, we cannot determine the real radius from measurement results alone (figure \ref{fig:aqauarium_result} and \ref{fig:aeolotron_result}). So we need to change the lighting in such a way that real radius, i.e. the whole bubble becomes visible. In a similar way to the light field method (cite Mischler), we used an additional light source and a mirror in order to light up the bubbles from behind (figure \ref{fig:radius_calibration_setup}). Then, we acquired images at a frame rate of 200 FPS and lit the additional light source every second frame. Results are shown in figure \ref{fig:radius_calibration_setup_result}. In section \ref{calibration_algorithm} we identify bubbles lit from below with those lit from behind in order to estimate the proportionality factor between the real radius and the radius computed by our algorithm.
